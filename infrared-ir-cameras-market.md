<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared (IR) Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cooled</li><li>Uncooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the infrared (IR) camera market, there are two main types: cooled and uncooled cameras. Cooled IR cameras require a cooling mechanism to maintain their operating temperature, usually using cryogenic cooling techniques. These cameras provide higher sensitivity and better image quality, making them ideal for advanced applications that require precise measurements. On the other hand, uncooled IR cameras operate at room temperature, eliminating the need for complex cooling systems and reducing costs. While uncooled cameras offer lower sensitivity and image quality, they are more affordable and suitable for general-purpose applications.</p></p>
