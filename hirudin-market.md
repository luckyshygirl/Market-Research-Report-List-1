<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hirudin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Hirudin</li><li>Recombinant Hirudin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hirudin is a protein derived from leeches and is used as an anticoagulant. There are two main types of Hirudin markets: natural and recombinant. Natural Hirudin is extracted directly from leeches, making it more costly and limited in supply. On the other hand, recombinant Hirudin is produced through genetic engineering, offering a more abundant and affordable alternative. Both types serve the same purpose of preventing blood clotting, but the market for natural Hirudin is smaller due to its higher cost and limited availability compared to recombinant Hirudin.</p></p>
