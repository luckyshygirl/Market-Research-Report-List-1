<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microneedle Drug Delivery Patches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dissolving Type</li><li>Insoluble Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Microneedle drug delivery patches are innovative devices used to administer drugs through the skin. There are two main types of microneedle patches: dissolving type and insoluble type. Dissolving type patches consist of small needles made from biodegradable materials that dissolve upon insertion, delivering the drug into the skin. Insoluble type patches are made of solid needles that are not biodegradable, often used for long-term drug delivery. Both types offer advantages such as painless drug delivery, increased patient compliance, and minimal side effects, making them promising alternatives to traditional injections.</p></p>
