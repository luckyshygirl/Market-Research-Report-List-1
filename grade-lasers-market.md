<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grade lasers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual Grade</li><li>Single Grade</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Grade lasers are widely used in construction and surveying for precise leveling and alignment. There are two main types of grade lasers - dual grade and single grade. </p><p>A dual grade laser allows for the control of both the X and Y axes, enabling the user to set multiple slopes simultaneously. It is ideal for complex projects that require precise grading on both sides.</p><p>On the other hand, a single grade laser only controls either the X or Y axis, making it suitable for simpler tasks where a single slope is sufficient. It is commonly used in landscaping, foundation work, and road construction.</p></p>
