<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cryogenic Liquid Tanks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum Powder Insulation Type</li><li>Atmospheric Pressure Powder Insulation Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cryogenic liquid tanks come in two main types: vacuum powder insulation type and atmospheric pressure powder insulation type. Vacuum powder insulation type tanks are designed to store cryogenic liquids at extremely low temperatures by surrounding the inner container with a vacuum layer and filling the gap with a powder insulating material. This design minimizes heat transfer and keeps the contents cold for extended periods. On the other hand, atmospheric pressure powder insulation type tanks use a similar insulation method but do not rely on a vacuum layer.</p></p>
