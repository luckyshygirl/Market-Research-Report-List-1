<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surrogacy Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gestational Surrogacy</li><li>Traditional Surrogacy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surrogacy services consist of two main types: gestational surrogacy and traditional surrogacy. Gestational surrogacy involves a surrogate mother who carries a baby conceived through in vitro fertilization (IVF), where the embryo is created using the intended parents' or donors' genetic material. The surrogate has no genetic relation to the child. In contrast, traditional surrogacy occurs when the surrogate mother uses her own egg and is inseminated with the intended father's sperm, making her genetically related to the child. Both types of surrogacy offer different options for individuals or couples seeking to have a child through a surrogate.</p></p>
