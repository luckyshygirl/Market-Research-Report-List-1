<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Scale Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Softeners</li><li>Reverse Osmosis</li><li>Ion Exchange</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-scale systems are devices designed to prevent the formation of scale in water systems. Softeners use a process called ion exchange to remove calcium and magnesium ions, the main components of scale, from the water. Reverse osmosis systems employ a filtration process that removes dissolved salts and minerals, preventing scale formation. Ion exchange systems work by replacing the calcium and magnesium ions with sodium or potassium ions, preventing scale buildup. These three types of anti-scale systems help to maintain the efficiency and prolong the lifespan of water equipment by preventing scale accumulation.</p></p>
