<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR) Evaporators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compressed Steam System</li><li>Water Vapor Distillation System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR) Evaporators are used for water evaporation processes. The Compressed Steam System in MVR evaporators compresses the steam generated during evaporation, increasing its temperature and pressure before reusing it as a heat source. This system is energy-efficient as it reduces the need for external steam. On the other hand, the Water Vapor Distillation System separates water from impurities by using vacuum-assisted evaporation. This process is especially useful in industries where pure water is required, such as pharmaceuticals or beverage production.</p></p>
