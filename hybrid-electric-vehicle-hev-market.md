<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Parallel Hybrid Electric Vehicle</li><li>Series Hybrid Electric Vehicle</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>A Parallel Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) incorporates both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor to provide power to the vehicle. The engine and motor work in parallel to drive the wheels, providing improved fuel efficiency. In contrast, a Series HEV uses the engine solely to charge the battery, which then powers the electric motor, thereby driving the wheels. The main difference lies in the powertrain configuration and the way the engine and electric motor interact to propel the vehicle, resulting in different levels of fuel efficiency and emissions reduction.</p></p>
