<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bradycardia Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacemaker</li><li>Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Bradycardia devices are used to treat slow heart rhythms. A pacemaker is a type of bradycardia device that helps regulate the heart's electrical activity by sending electrical signals to the heart muscles, ensuring a normal rhythm. Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) are another type of bradycardia device that not only regulate the heart's rhythm but also deliver an electric shock to restore normal rhythms in case of dangerous arrhythmias. Both pacemakers and ICDs are implanted inside the body and help prevent symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, and fainting associated with bradycardia.</p></p>
