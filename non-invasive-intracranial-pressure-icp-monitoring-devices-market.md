<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-invasive Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Monitoring Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sound Signal Detection</li><li>Blood Flow Signal Detection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-invasive Intracranial Pressure (ICP) monitoring devices market includes two main types: sound signal detection and blood flow signal detection. Sound signal detection devices measure ICP by analyzing the sound emitted by blood flow in the brain. They are easy to use but less accurate compared to other devices. On the other hand, blood flow signal detection devices measure ICP by analyzing the changes in cerebral blood flow velocity. These devices provide more accurate results but may require skilled operators. Both types offer non-invasive alternatives to traditional invasive methods in monitoring intracranial pressure.</p></p>
