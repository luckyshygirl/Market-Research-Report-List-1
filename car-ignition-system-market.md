<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Ignition System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spark Plug</li><li>Ignition Coil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The car ignition system market consists of two main types: spark plugs and ignition coils. Spark plugs are crucial components that create a spark in the combustion chamber, igniting the air-fuel mixture to start the engine. Ignition coils, on the other hand, are responsible for converting and amplifying the battery's voltage to create the high-voltage needed to generate a spark in the spark plugs. Both spark plugs and ignition coils play essential roles in the ignition process, ensuring that cars start and run smoothly.</p></p>
