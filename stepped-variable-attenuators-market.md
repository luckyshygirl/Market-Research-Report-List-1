<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stepped Variable Attenuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manually Variable Attenuators</li><li>Continuously Variable Attenuators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Stepped variable attenuators are electronic devices used to control the amplitude of signals. Manually variable attenuators require human intervention to adjust the attenuation level, usually done by rotating a knob or switch. They offer precise control but may be slower in operation. On the other hand, continuously variable attenuators provide a smooth, uninterrupted attenuation adjustment, often using an electronic control mechanism. These are quicker to adjust but may trade off a bit of precision compared to the stepped type. Both types are extensively used in various industries for signal attenuation and control purposes.</p></p>
