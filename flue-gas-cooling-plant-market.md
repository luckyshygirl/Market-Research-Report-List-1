<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flue Gas Cooling Plant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Cooling</li><li>Indirect Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Flue Gas Cooling Plant market offers two types of cooling systems: direct cooling and indirect cooling. In direct cooling, the flue gas is cooled directly using water or air, reducing its temperature before emission into the atmosphere. Indirect cooling, on the other hand, utilizes a heat exchanger to transfer heat from the flue gas to a cooling medium, such as water or air. Both cooling methods aim to minimize environmental impact by lowering the temperature of flue gas and reducing harmful emissions into the air.</p></p>
