BEVs are fully electric vehicles that rely solely on battery power to operate. They do not have an internal combustion engine and produce zero emissions. On the other hand, PHEVs have both a battery and an internal combustion engine. They can be charged from an external power source but also have the ability to switch to using petrol or diesel when the battery is depleted. PHEVs generally have a shorter electric-only range compared to BEVs. Both types of vehicles cater to the growing demand for electric transportation options.</p></p>
