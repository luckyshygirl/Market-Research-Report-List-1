<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Monitoring Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Monitoring</li><li>Noninvasive Monitoring</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Intracranial monitoring equipment market types include invasive monitoring and noninvasive monitoring. Invasive monitoring involves placing a probe or electrode inside the skull to directly measure intracranial pressure or brain activity. This method provides precise and real-time data but carries risks of infection and bleeding. Noninvasive monitoring, on the other hand, relies on external devices such as sensors or imaging techniques to indirectly assess intracranial pressure or brain function. Although less accurate than invasive methods, noninvasive monitoring offers a safer and more convenient option for monitoring patients with brain injuries or conditions.</p></p>
