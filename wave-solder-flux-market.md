<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wave Solder Flux Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Corrosive</li><li>Non-Corrosive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wave solder flux market is categorized into two types: corrosive and non-corrosive. Corrosive fluxes are formulated with aggressive chemicals that actively remove oxides and other contaminants from metal surfaces. These fluxes are commonly used in applications where heavy oxidation needs to be eliminated. On the other hand, non-corrosive fluxes are milder and are designed to prevent oxidation without aggressively removing it. They are employed in applications where the delicate components could be damaged by corrosive fluxes. Both types have their specific use cases based on the level of oxidation and protection required.</p></p>
