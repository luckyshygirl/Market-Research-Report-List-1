<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corrosion Inhibiting Compounds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Based</li><li>Oil-Based/Solvent</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The corrosion inhibiting compounds market is divided into two main types - water-based and oil-based/solvent-based. Water-based corrosion inhibitors are solutions that are dissolved in water and applied to metal surfaces to prevent corrosion. They form a protective layer on the metal, preventing the contact of moisture and corrosive substances. On the other hand, oil-based/solvent-based inhibitors are made up of organic compounds dissolved in oil or solvents. These inhibitors provide a barrier on metal surfaces, preventing the corrosion process by obstructing the interaction of corrosive elements with the metal.</p></p>
