<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trolley-mounted Anesthesia Workstation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Respiratory Monitoring</li><li>Without Respiratory Monitoring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The trolley-mounted anesthesia workstation market consists of two types: with respiratory monitoring and without respiratory monitoring. Anesthesia workstations with respiratory monitoring technology are equipped with advanced systems that continuously monitor the patient's breathing and oxygen levels during surgery or procedures. This ensures the anesthesiologist can closely monitor and adjust the patient's respiratory parameters as needed. On the other hand, trolley-mounted anesthesia workstations without respiratory monitoring do not have this feature, which means that the anesthesiologist manually monitors the patient's breathing and oxygen levels during the procedure.</p></p>
