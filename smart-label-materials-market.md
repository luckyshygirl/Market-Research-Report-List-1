<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Label Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-based</li><li>Solvent-free/Water-based Products</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Smart label materials can be classified into two types: solvent-based and solvent-free/water-based products. Solvent-based materials are made using solvents as a carrier for the label adhesive, ink, and other components. These materials require a drying period to evaporate the solvent, which can be time-consuming. On the other hand, solvent-free/water-based products use water as a carrier instead, eliminating the need for drying time. These materials are more environmentally friendly and have gained popularity due to their quick drying and low emission properties.</p></p>
