<p><strong>The Passenger Car Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passenger Car Tires Market Types: Radial Tires and Bias Tyres. Radial tires are designed with cords that run radially across the tire, providing a flexible sidewall for a smooth and comfortable ride. This design allows the tire to have better traction and longer durability. Bias tyres, on the other hand, have cords that run diagonally from bead to bead, providing a stiff sidewall for better load-carrying capacity. Although bias tyres have a simpler construction and are generally cheaper, they provide a rougher ride and lower fuel efficiency compared to radial tires.</p></p>
